Key Features:

Data Exploration: Analyze historical rainfall data through various visualizations.
Predictions: Get rainfall predictions for any date within the dataset range and up to 500 years in the future.
Model Performance: Evaluate the machine learning model's performance through various metrics and visualizations.
Rainfall Map: Visualize rainfall patterns across Chennai using an interactive map.
The app uses a deep learning model trained on historical data to make predictions. It considers factors such as date, location, season, and day of the week to estimate the probability of rainfall.

Data Source: The data used in this app is sourced from historical weather information for Chennai.

Note: Predictions are based on historical patterns and may not account for all factors affecting weather. Always refer to official weather forecasts for critical decision-making.

        Excited to share that I had the opportunity to participate in HACK RUSH 1.0, a 36-hour hackathon organized by the Qwiklabs Developer Club at SRM Institute of Science and Technology.

From 30th Sept to 1st Oct 2024, I worked alongside an incredible team, and I'd like to give a special shoutout to John Paul whose contributions played a pivotal role in our project's success. The event pushed us to collaborate, innovate, and solve real-world problems under tight deadlines.

A huge thanks to Qwiklabs Developer Club, Dr. Geetha G (Faculty Convenor), Dr. M. Lakshmi (Head of Department, NWC), and all the organizers for creating such a challenging and rewarding experience. Looking forward to applying these insights in future projects!  {" "}
